/**
 * <p>A <b>Single Source Shortest Path Problem</b> is defined as: Given an Edge Weighted Digraph and a Source Node s, support queries of the form, "Is there a Directed Path from s to a Given
 * Target Node t?", if so, find the Shortest Such Path.  A Shortest Path from Vertex s to Vertex t in an Edge Weighted Digraph is a Directed Path from s to t with the property that no such other
 * path has a Lower Weight.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two primary algorithms for solving the Single Source Shortest Paths Problem in an Edge Weighted Digraph: <b>Dijkstra's Algorithm</b> and the <b>Bellman Ford Algorithm</b>.</p>
 *
 * {@code DijkstrasAlgorithm} implements <em>Dijkstra's Algorithm</em> which solves the Single Source Shortest Paths Problem in an Edge Weighted Digraph with Non-Negative Weights.  <em>Dijkstra's
 * Algorithm</em> works as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The first step is to set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and set the distance of all other vertices to infinity.</li>
 *     <li>A priority queue is used to store vertices, ensuring the vertex with the shortest distance to the current vertex is removed next.  Once a vertex is removed from the priority queue, the
 *     algorithm examines all its neighbours.  For each neighbouring vertex, it calculates the distance through the current vertex.</li>
 *     <li>If the distance is smaller than the previously known distance, the neighbour's distance is updated, and the new distance replaces the old distance in the priority queue.</li>
 *     <li>This process continues until all vertices have been visited.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * @param Vertex is a Generic Type for Vertices in the Graph.
